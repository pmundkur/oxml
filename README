oxml is currently a simple incremental XML non-conforming parser with
a SAX API.  

The parser was written in order to parse simple XML-based network
protocols in asynchronous client-server applications.  Most of the
complexity inducing portions of the XML specification has not been
implemented, primarily support for DTD parsing and validation, 
parsed external entities, and Unicode.

In particular, with reference to the XML 1.1 specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204:

- Since there is no support for DTD whatsoever, features
  that rely on DTD declarations like internal DTD sections,
  conditional sections, entity and notation declarations are not
  supported.

- No entities other than the predefined entities of Section 4.6 are
  supported.

- Attributes are always treated as of type CDATA, and attribute values
  are normalized as specified in Section 3.3.3 of the XML 1.1
  specification.  Charset encoding declarations are basically ignored,
  and only ISO 8859-1 encoding is supported.

- xml:space is not implemented; all whitespace in element content is
  treated as significant.

The following well-formedness constraints of the XML 1.1 specification
are not implemented:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#ExtSubset
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#PE-between-Decls
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#wfc-PEinInternalSubset
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#wf-entdeclared

The following well-formedness constraints are implemented:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#GIMatch
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#uniqattspec
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#NoExternalRefs
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#CleanAttrVals
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#uniqattspec

(the implementation of the next constraint is restricted to the
 ISO 8859-1 charset)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#wf-Legalchar 

(the next two constraints fall out trivially, since entity
 declarations are not supported)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#textent 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#norecursion

(the next constraint is also trivial, since internal DTD subsets are
 not supported)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/#indtd

End-of-line normalization (Section 2.11) is implemented.
