oxml is currently a simple incremental XML non-conforming parser with
a SAX API.

It is non-conforming in the sense it

- does not dereference any external doctypes or entities in 
  non-standalone documents. Consequently, non-standalone documents
  that are not well-formed may be parsed with no error.

- does not support entity and notation declarations and references,
  and all numerical character references (only the subset of numerical
  character references with values within the 0-255 range).  Unknown
  entity and character references are left intact and passed to the
  application; this is another reason why non-well-formed documents
  may be passed without error.

- does not parse parameter declarations and references, and internal 
  subsets of DTD declarations in the document.

- cannot perform DTD validation.

- only handles characters in the ISO 8859-1 encoding.

- does not check character and parsed entity normalization.

- performs limited normalization of attribute values (only references
  to the predefined entities and some character references are
  normalized, viz. the subset mentioned above).

It also does not directly provide any namespace information to the
application; the application needs to deduce this information from its
SAX callbacks.

The reason this parser was written was to parse simple custom XML
network protocols in client-server applications.
