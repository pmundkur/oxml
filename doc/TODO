- testing:
  . check the return value of parse
  . try enabling/disabling/resuming parsing at different points in the
    event stream.  especially test for the case when the client
    disables parsing during a start_elem callback for an atomic
    element without a separate end tag (e.g. <A att="" />) (the parser
    should call the end_tag callback as soon as parsing is resumed.)

- more accurate errors for attribute names and start elements.
  currently error positions will correspond to the end of the start
  element.

- a proper regression testing harness
